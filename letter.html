Dear Jordan,
Thank you for expressing interest in our Creative Arts program at the Siena

Available Courses
Our art program offers a diverse range of courses, focusing on both traditional

particularly exciting. Here are the courses that might interest you:
Modern Digital Art and Its Cultural Impact.
Interactive Media Art and Virtual Reality.
Sculpture Techniques: From Clay to Digital Models.
One of the courses that might interest you is "Chemical Reactions in Art",
where we will explore molecules like Glucose (C6H12O6) and their role in
conservation techniques.
We'd appreciate more details on your specific interests within these areas,
including any particular projects or research themes you're considering.
Artistic Inspirations
It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern
art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:
Impressionism
Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction
of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
Abstract Expressionism
This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had
a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.
Pop Art
A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular
culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.

Prof. Alex Hartley
