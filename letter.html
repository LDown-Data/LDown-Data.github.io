        <h3>Artistic Inspirations</h3>
        <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern
            art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:</p>
        <p>Impressionism<br>
            <a class="tab">Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction
            of light. It has </a><br><a class="tab">profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.</a><br>
            Abstract Expressionism<br>
            <a class="tab">This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had
            a significant </a><br><a class="tab">impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.</a><br>
            Pop Art<br>
            <a class="tab">A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular
            culture, leading </a><br><a class="tab">to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.</a>
        </p>
